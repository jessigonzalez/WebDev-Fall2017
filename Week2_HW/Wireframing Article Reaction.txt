The article written by Lissa Aguilar, titled "Five Important Considerations for Wireframing" is a warning or a 
public service announcement piece of writing from one UX Architect to those attempting to do a UX developers job.
This article is more so aimed to an ameteur or someone dabbling in web development coding, as I assume someone with
 more knowledge in this area of expertise would know the signicance of wireframing. The importance of wireframing 
is very much emphasized in this article. It is proven to be a vital step that saves time, minimizes confusion, and
 creates a clear path when creating a website. Wireframing is a necessary step to perform, and if you don't do it
 you just create unnecessary problems for yourself, that could have easily been avoided.
